-- Follow-up to 20260714220000: the cancellation guard there blocked ANY
-- direct client update to status = 'cancelled', which also silently broke
-- the pre-existing, out-of-scope admin resolution path (disputed/no_show ->
-- cancelled, via a plain table update — see 20260712140000). Module 2 only
-- ever needed to close off the pending/confirmed normal-cancellation path;
-- narrows the guard to that so disputed/no_show resolution keeps working
-- exactly as it did before this module. Full replace, identical to
-- 20260714220000's body otherwise.
